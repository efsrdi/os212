1. [Install and Configure UFW on Debian 11 or 10](https://www.how2shout.com/linux/install-and-configure-ufw-on-debian-11-or-10/)<br>
This page is about how to install and configure UFW firewall on Debian 11 or 10.
I find this page useful because the explanation and step is very clear and it may help those who have encountered problem such as "Connection Refused" Error on SSH.

2. [How to Fix the SSH “Connection Refused” Error](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/ssh-connection-refused/)<br>
This page contained several tips on how to fix SSH "Connection Refused" Error.
I find it useful when I encountered problems on SSH like "Connection Refused" error. 
Although the tips there may not provide absolute solutions due to the fact that there are many possibilites that can caused an SSH "Connection Refused" error.
But I think it still can provide some knowledge on how to tackle problem like this.

3. [Learn C - Free Interactive C Tutorial](https://www.learn-c.org/)<br>
I've learned basics of C with this page. It is a very useful page for those who wish to start
studying C. It is interactive and it covers all of the basics about C.

4. [Vim Cheat Sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/)<br>
I used this page as my vim cheat sheet everytime I'm using Vim. I think it is useful for those who are in a
hurry since this page only consists of the commands and their explanation.

5. [File Systems in Operating System: Structure, Attributes, Type](https://www.guru99.com/file-systems-operating-system.html)<br>
This page consist a brief explanation about file systems. I think it is useful for those who just want 
to know the basic idea of what file system is.

6. [FUSE--The Linux Kernel Documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html#)<br>
This page is a documentation on what FUSE is and how to use it. In my opinion, I think this is useful for
those who already had a minor understanding about what FUSE is and like reading documentations.

7. [File Systems and FUSE](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15213-s07/lectures/15-filesys/index.html)<br>
This page is also talking about FUSE and File systems like the page on number 6. But the difference is, and also
the reason why I think this page is useful, is because this page only gives a brief explanation about what
FUSE is and how it works using a diagram.

8. [Linux File Hierarchy Structure - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-file-hierarchy-structure/)<br>
This page explains Linux File Hierarchy Structure or the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard(FHS). The reason I recommended
this page is because this page also gives the explanation about FHS in a diagram.
